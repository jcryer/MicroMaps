Welcome to our new app, this home screen you may be familair with from other navigation apps.
There is a map you can zoom and pan, a search bar to find where you want to go and a level selector
in the top right corner.
Lets say we are ugently need the toilet, we can go to the bar at the top and search toilet.
As you can see from the suggestions, we have been in this situation before. 
Since I am currently on the ground floor, I will choose the toilet on the ground floor.
This window allows us to select the type of route we want to take, since its urgent I will pick
the fastest option.
Now all I have to do is follow the directions and take care of my business, but ill spare you from
that experience
