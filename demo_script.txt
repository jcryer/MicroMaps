Welcome to our new app.
We designed the main screen with familiarity in mind, and so it is similar to many other navigation apps.


There is a map you can zoom and pan, a search bar to find where you want to go and a level selector
in the top right corner.

Let's say we urgently need the toilet. We can go to the bar at the top and search "toilet ground floor".
As you can see from the suggestions, we have been in this situation before. 
This window allows us to select the type of route we want to take, since it's urgent I will pick
the fastest option.
Now all I have to do is follow the directions to where I want to go.
